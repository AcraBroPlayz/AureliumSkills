Abilities and Skill Trees
Here comes the most UNIQUE part about this plugin, abilities and skill trees! Each Skill has up to 15 unique abilities that grant the player a perk, buff, or other beneficial mechanic. Abilities are viewed, upgraded, and unlocked in the Skill Tree, an actual tree mechanic which requires lower abilities to be unlocked before unlocking the abilities higher up. Abilities are unlocked and upgraded with Skill Points, a skill specific currency gained by leveling up the specific skill.
