        - Ex: '- IRON_PICKAXE MINING:10 ENDURANCE:5' <- This would require Mining 10 and Endurance 5 to use ANY iron pickaxe

      - For example, "aureliumskills.multiplier.50" is 50% more XP, or 1.5x
      - Multipliers can stack! The value for all multipliers is added together and applied at the same time, so a 50 and 100 multiplier together will yield 150% more XP (2.5x)
